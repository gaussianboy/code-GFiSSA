To recreate the simulation results, do the following:
1) Simulate data with the script "paper_simulation.R". You would need a cluster for that.
2) Once the data is simulated, the GF_iSSA model can be applied to the simulated tracks based on the script "model_code.R".

To recreate the real data results, do the following:
1) Download the corresponding spatial covariates as indicated by Glass et. al 2021. The tracks can be downloaded in the Movebank repository indicated in our manuscript (https://doi.org/10.5441/001/1.290).
2) Clean the data with the script "female_wolverine_preparation.R".
3) Fit the model with the script "real_data_application.R".
