To recreate the simulation results, do the following:
1) Simulate data with the script "paper_simulation.R".
2) Once the data is simulated, the GF_iSSA model can be applied based on the script "paper_code_mkd.Rmd".

To recreate the real data results, do the following:
1) Download the corresponding spatial covariates as indicated by Glass et. al 2021. The tracks can be downloaded in the Movebank repository indicated in our manuscript.
2) Clean the data with the script "female_wolverine_preparation.R".
3) Fit the model with the script "real_data_application.R".
